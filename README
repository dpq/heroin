I think we'll be moving in the following direction:

	HxEngine
The game's logic is implemented here. It is sort of a dedicated server.

	HxAbstractPlayer
The interface that must be implemented by player classes to connect to the server.

	HxAiPlayer, HxHumanPlayer
Subclasses of HxAbstractPlayer are supposed to interface with the player on one side and the server on the other side.
